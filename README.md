## Introduction
Robotic automation has revolutionized modern **automotive production, ensuring high precision, efficiency, and scalability**. This project simulates a car assembly line using **RoboDK**, where two **KUKA robotic arms** perform **door and windshield** installation in a structured two-stage process.

The main objective of this project is to demonstrate the automation potential of robotic arms in a car manufacturing setting. Using conveyors, robotic arms, and precise inverse kinematics programming, the project successfully replicates a real-world car assembly line.

**Key Features**

- Fully simulated assembly line with conveyors, robots, and car components

- Automated door and windshield installation process

- High-precision motion control using inverse kinematics

- Two industrial robotic arms working in coordination

- Scalable and adaptable simulation for real-world manufacturing applications


## Design Process of Assembly line
The car assembly line consists of a multi-stage workflow, where robotic arms interact with the moving car. The design process involves:

1. Setting up the Conveyor System:
   - The conveyor moves the car to predefined positions, ensuring that robots can operate efficiently.
2. Positioning the Robotic Arms:
   - Two KUKA robotic arms are placed on either side of the conveyor to handle the doors and windshield installation.
3. Defining Assembly Stages:
   - Stage 1: Door Installation
      - The left robotic arm installs the left door.
      - The right robotic arm installs the right door.
   - Stage 2: Windshield Installation
      - The right robotic arm applies glue to the car frame.
      - The right robotic arm picks up the windshield and places it precisely.
  
4. Programming the Motion Sequences:
     - Target points are set for each movement.
     - Robots follow pre-programmed inverse kinematics paths to reach targets with high accuracy.

## Robot Arms
This project utilizes two powerful KUKA robotic arms, chosen for their precision, durability, and payload capacity:

1. ðŸ¦¾ KUKA-KR-50-R2500
       - Function: Responsible for handling and installing the car doors.
       - Payload: 50 kg
