## Introduction
Robotic automation has revolutionized modern **automotive production, ensuring high precision, efficiency, and scalability**. This project simulates a car assembly line using **RoboDK**, where two **KUKA robotic arms** perform **door and windshield** installation in a structured two-stage process.

The main objective of this project is to demonstrate the automation potential of robotic arms in a car manufacturing setting. Using conveyors, robotic arms, and precise inverse kinematics programming, the project successfully replicates a real-world car assembly line.

**Key Features**

- Fully simulated assembly line with conveyors, robots, and car components

- Automated door and windshield installation process

- High-precision motion control using inverse kinematics

- Two industrial robotic arms working in coordination

- Scalable and adaptable simulation for real-world manufacturing applications


## Design Process of Assembly line
The car assembly line consists of a multi-stage workflow, where robotic arms interact with the moving car. The design process involves:

1. Setting up the Conveyor System:
   - The conveyor moves the car to predefined positions, ensuring that robots can operate efficiently.
2. Positioning the Robotic Arms:
   - Two KUKA robotic arms are placed on either side of the conveyor to handle the doors and windshield installation.
3. Defining Assembly Stages:
   - Stage 1: Door Installation
      - The left robotic arm installs the left door.
      - The right robotic arm installs the right door.
   - Stage 2: Windshield Installation
      - The right robotic arm applies glue to the car frame.
      - The right robotic arm picks up the windshield and places it precisely.
  
4. Programming the Motion Sequences:
     - Target points are set for each movement.
     - Robots follow pre-programmed inverse kinematics paths to reach targets with high accuracy.

## Robot Arms
This project utilizes two powerful KUKA robotic arms, chosen for their precision, durability, and payload capacity:


1. ü¶æ KUKA-KR-50-R2500:
   - Function: Responsible for handling and installing the car doors.
   - Payload: 50 kg
   - Reach: 2500 mm
   - Application: Used for picking up doors and placing them onto the car frame.

2. ü¶æ KUKA-KR-360-2:
   - Function: Responsible for windshield installation.
   - Payload: 360 kg
   - Reach: 2826 mm
   - Application: Used for applying glue and placing the windshield with high precision.



Both robotic arms are programmed to work simultaneously and efficiently, ensuring smooth automation.
      


## Programming
The robot arms are programmed using inverse kinematics, which enables precise movement to predefined target points. The programming follows a structured sequence:

1. üü¢ Step 1: Define Targets:
    - Multiple target points are set for door and windshield installation.
    - Each robot is assigned specific waypoints to ensure smooth movement.
  
2. üü¢ Step 2: Inverse Kinematics Implementation
    - Robots use inverse kinematics to calculate joint movements, ensuring high accuracy and repeatability.
    - RoboDK provides offline programming, allowing efficient simulation before real-world implementation.
  
3. üü¢ Step 3: Execution of Assembly Tasks
    - Stage 1: Installing the Left and Right Doors
      - Left Robot: Picks up the left door and aligns it with the car frame.
      - Right Robot: Picks up the right door and installs it in place.
      - Both robots synchronize their movements for simultaneous door installation.

    - Stage 2: Installing the Front Windshield
      - Right Robot: Applies glue to the windshield area.
      - Right Robot: Picks up the windshield and carefully places it with high precision.

**The robots operate in perfect coordination, replicating an industrial assembly line.**



## Challenges
