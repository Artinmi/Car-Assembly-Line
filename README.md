#  Car Assembly Line that assembles the front windshield and doors of a car in RoboDK
## Automotive Manufacturing
This project aims to simulate an automated Car Assembly Line using RoboDK, focusing on the assembly of the front windshield and car doors. The simulation leverages two industrial robotic arms:
- KUKA-KR-50-R2500 – responsible for handling and assembling the car doors.
- KUKA-KR-360-2 – tasked with positioning and installing the front windshield.
  
By utilizing RoboDK, a leading robotic simulation and offline programming software, this project demonstrates the efficiency and feasibility of robotic automation in the automotive manufacturing sector. The developed system provides a comprehensive, full-package solution for implementing automation in modern car production lines, showcasing the potential of industrial robotics to improve precision, efficiency, and scalability in automotive assembly.

## Introduction
The goal of this project was to design a functional robotic leg that could be optimized using the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm. The leg mechanism is a four-bar linkage system, designed for flexibility and robustness in movement. 

## Design Process of Assembly line
The robot leg was designed using SolidWorks, focusing on a four-bar linkage mechanism, which offers simplicity and effective force transmission. After modeling the components, they were evaluated and adjusted to meet the functional requirements.
